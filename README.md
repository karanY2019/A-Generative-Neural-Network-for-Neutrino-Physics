A Generative Neural Network for Neutrino Physics-Water Cherenkov Reconstruction
We are exploring an alternative approach to the more traditional “end-to-end” CNN
event classification for reconstruction of water Cherenkov events

I mainly contibuted to the likelihood scans to perform the investigatation by evaluating loss funtion as a function of energy.
